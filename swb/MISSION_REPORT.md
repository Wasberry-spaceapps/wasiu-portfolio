# STRATEGY: SWEET BIRCH HERBALS
Build these prototypes to demonstrate CAPABILITY.

## PROJECT 1: Simulated Wix Content Sync API for Dynamic Updates
**Pitch:** I developed a conceptual API integration framework to dynamically update Wix website content from an external data source, streamlining content management.
**Tech:** Node.js, RESTful API Design, JSON
**Details:** I created a Node.js backend simulating a data pipeline that fetches product information from a mock external database. This system then models pushing updates to a theoretical Wix headless CMS API endpoint, showcasing automated content refresh capabilities.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype: Establish a Node.js server and define a mock external data source.
2. Next step: Design API endpoints to simulate content fetching and 'pushing' updates.
3. Final step: Demonstrate data transformation and content synchronization logic.

## PROJECT 2: Real-time Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis Dashboard
**Pitch:** I built a personal interactive dashboard to analyze customer feedback sentiment, providing immediate insights into customer satisfaction trends.
**Tech:** Python, Streamlit, NLTK
**Details:** I developed a Python Streamlit application that processes simulated customer reviews using the NLTK library for sentiment analysis. The dashboard dynamically visualizes positive, negative, and neutral sentiment distribution, allowing for quick identification of emerging issues.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype: Set up a Python environment with Streamlit and NLTK.
2. Next step: Implement a sentiment analysis function and create data visualization components.
