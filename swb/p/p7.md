# Brand Voice Style Guide: [Brand Name] Wellness
**Core Identity:** The Grounded Guide. We are the bridge between ancestral wisdom and modern daily life.

## 1. Tone & Personality
*   **Grounded:** We use sensory language (soil, scent, roots). We are not "woo-woo" without substance; we are rooted in the earth.
*   **Warm but Authoritative:** We speak like a wise elder or a mentor. We don't use hype or "crush it" culture.
*   **Rhythmic:** Our prose has a natural cadence. Long, descriptive sentences followed by short, impactful ones.
