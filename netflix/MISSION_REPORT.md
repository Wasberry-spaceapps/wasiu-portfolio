# STRATEGY: NETFLIX
Build these prototypes to demonstrate CAPABILITY.

## PROJECT 1: Movie Data Aggregator & API Service
**Pitch:** I developed a personal service to aggregate movie metadata from various online sources.
**Tech:** Python, BeautifulSoup, Flask
**Details:** I built a Python script utilizing web scraping libraries to extract film details from public databases. This data was then structured and exposed via a lightweight RESTful API for personal applications.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype using Python to scrape movie data from public websites.
2. Next step, design a simple database schema to store the scraped information efficiently.
3. Final step, implement a Flask API to expose the stored movie data for retrieval and filtering.

## PROJECT 2: Personalized Cinematic Recommendation Engine
**Pitch:** I designed a prototype recommendation engine to suggest movies based on an individual's viewing history and preferences.
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
**Details:** I created a Python-based system that uses collaborative filtering techniques on a sample dataset of movie ratings. The engine identifies patterns to generate relevant film suggestions, considering genre and actor preferences.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by sourcing a public dataset of movie ratings and user preferences.
2. Next step, implement a basic collaborative filtering algorithm (e.g., k-nearest neighbors) to find similar users or items.
3. Final step, develop a function to generate personalized movie recommendations based on a user's simulated watch history.

## PROJECT 3: Dynamic Calendar Integration for Film Events
**Pitch:** I built a simple web application to manage and display a personal movie screening calendar.
**Tech:** JavaScript, Node.js, Google Calendar API
**Details:** I developed a front-end interface using JavaScript to interact with a custom backend that syncs with a major calendar API (e.g., Google Calendar). This allows for easy creation, viewing, and modification of film-related events.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by setting up API access credentials for a calendar service like Google Calendar.
2. Next step, create a Node.js backend to handle OAuth authentication and manage calendar event CRUD operations.
3. Final step, develop a simple front-end application (e.g., using React or vanilla JS) to interact with the backend and display events.

## PROJECT 4: Advanced Movie Database Query System
**Pitch:** I developed a robust search and filtering system for a movie database to enable complex data retrieval.
**Tech:** SQL, PostgreSQL, Data Studio
**Details:** I designed a schema and implemented advanced SQL queries to allow users to filter movies by multiple criteria like genre, release year range, actor, director, and average rating. This system leverages indexing for performance optimization.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by designing a comprehensive relational database schema for movie metadata.
2. Next step, populate the database with sample movie data and create a series of advanced SQL queries for complex filtering.
3. Final step, visualize query results using a data visualization tool to demonstrate the system's analytical capabilities.

## PROJECT 5: Automated Movie Release Tracking Workflow
**Pitch:** I created a personal automated workflow to track upcoming movie releases and provide timely notifications.
**Tech:** Zapier, RSS Feeds, Slack
**Details:** I configured a series of no-code automation tools to monitor movie news sites and public APIs. When a new release date is announced for a watch-listed film, the system automatically sends a notification to a chosen communication channel.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by identifying reliable RSS feeds or public APIs for new movie release information.
2. Next step, set up an automation platform (e.g., Zapier, Make.com) to trigger a workflow upon detecting new releases.
3. Final step, configure the automation to send personalized notifications (e.g., email, Slack message) with relevant movie details.

## PROJECT 6: Dynamic Movie Watchlist Prioritization System
**Pitch:** I designed a custom system to dynamically prioritize my movie watchlist based on evolving preferences and availability.
**Tech:** Google Sheets, Excel, Conditional Logic
**Details:** I built a spreadsheet-based tool augmented with conditional formatting and custom formulas that factors in criteria like streaming platform availability, critical reception, and personal genre interest. This provides an optimized viewing order.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by creating a structured spreadsheet to log movie titles, genres, actors, and streaming availability.
2. Next step, implement custom formulas and conditional formatting to assign a priority score based on user-defined criteria.
3. Final step, develop a visualization within the spreadsheet to clearly display the prioritized watchlist and highlight top recommendations.

## PROJECT 7: Optimized Movie Night Scheduling Framework
**Pitch:** I developed a strategic framework for efficiently coordinating movie night events among multiple participants.
**Tech:** Google Calendar, Doodle Poll, Slack
**Details:** I created a structured process combining shared calendar tools, poll mechanisms for availability, and a simple voting system for movie selection. This minimizes friction and maximizes participation for group viewings.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by outlining the key stages of group event planning, from availability gathering to final confirmation.
2. Next step, integrate shared calendar platforms and polling tools to streamline the collection of participant availability.
3. Final step, design a communication protocol (e.g., using a group chat) to facilitate movie selection and disseminate event details.

## PROJECT 8: Cinematic Genre Trend Analysis
**Pitch:** I conducted a data analysis project to identify evolving trends in movie genre popularity and critical reception over time.
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
**Details:** I utilized a public movie dataset, applying statistical analysis and visualization techniques to uncover patterns in audience ratings and critical scores across various genres over several decades.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by acquiring a comprehensive public dataset of movie information, including genres and ratings.
2. Next step, clean and preprocess the data using Python, focusing on extracting relevant features like release year and genre.
3. Final step, perform statistical analysis and create visualizations to illustrate trends in genre popularity and average ratings over different time periods.
