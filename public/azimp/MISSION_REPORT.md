# STRATEGY: AZIMP
Build these prototypes to demonstrate CAPABILITY.

## PROJECT 1: Real-time Website Performance Monitor
**Pitch:** I designed a prototype dashboard to aggregate and visualize key website performance metrics.
**Tech:** Python (Flask), Google Analytics API, JavaScript (Chart.js)
**Details:** I integrated with various web APIs (e.g., Google Analytics, Lighthouse, custom server logs) to pull data on page load times, traffic sources, and user engagement. I built a lightweight web interface to present these insights in an actionable format, enabling quick identification of performance bottlenecks.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype: Select core KPIs (e.g., page load, bounce rate, unique visitors).
2. Next step: Utilize public APIs (e.g., Google Analytics, PageSpeed Insights) or develop custom scraping tools to gather data.
3. Final step: Design and implement a simple web dashboard using a framework like Flask or Node.js to visualize the collected data dynamically.

## PROJECT 2: Automated SEO Keyword Opportunity Identifier
**Pitch:** I built a custom tool to streamline keyword research and identify high-potential SEO opportunities.
**Tech:** Python (Requests, Pandas), Google Search Console API, Data Visualization Library
**Details:** I developed a Python script that leverages public SEO APIs (e.g., Google Search Console, Ahrefs/Semrush alternatives) to analyze competitor keywords, search volume, and difficulty. This tool automatically suggests content topics and strategic keyword clusters for website optimization.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype: Define target audience and competitor websites for analysis.
2. Next step: Integrate with a free or freemium SEO API (e.g., Google Search Console for your own site, or a simple web scraper for public data).
3. Final step: Develop a script to process the data, identify keyword gaps, and generate a prioritized list of content opportunities.

## PROJECT 3: Dynamic Content Update & Migration Script
**Pitch:** I created a personal tool to automate repetitive content management tasks within a CMS environment.
**Tech:** Python (Requests), CMS REST API (e.g., WordPress), JSON
**Details:** I developed a Python script that interacts with a CMS API (e.g., WordPress REST API, headless CMS API) to automate bulk content updates, schedule posts, or migrate content between staging and production. This significantly reduces manual effort and potential errors in content operations.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype: Choose a specific, repetitive content task (e.g., updating author bios across many posts).
2. Next step: Explore the chosen CMS's API documentation (e.g., WordPress REST API, Strapi API) to understand available endpoints.
3. Final step: Write a script to authenticate with the API and automate the content update or migration process, ensuring error handling.

## PROJECT 4: Comprehensive Website Content Audit & Optimization Strategy
**Pitch:** I conducted a detailed audit of a sample website's content to identify gaps, redundancies, and opportunities for improvement.
**Tech:** Google Analytics (Simulated Data), Excel/Google Sheets, Content Matrix
**Details:** I analyzed content performance using simulated analytics data, mapped content to user journey stages, and developed a strategic roadmap for content refresh, creation, and deprecation. This approach aims to maximize SEO value and user engagement.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype: Select a publicly available website for a content audit case study.
2. Next step: Categorize existing content, assess its quality, freshness, and alignment with target keywords.
3. Final step: Develop a strategic plan outlining content updates, new content creation, and a maintenance schedule based on your audit findings.

## PROJECT 5: Data-Driven User Journey Optimization Framework
**Pitch:** I developed a concept framework for mapping and optimizing critical user journeys on a website to enhance conversion and satisfaction.
**Tech:** Google Analytics (Simulated Funnels), Figma/Miro, A/B Testing Framework
**Details:** I utilized simulated user behavior data (e.g., clickstreams, heatmaps) to identify friction points and drop-off rates across key conversion funnels. I proposed targeted UX improvements and A/B test hypotheses to address these issues.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype: Define a key user goal or conversion path for a website (e.g., signing up, purchasing a product).
2. Next step: Map out the theoretical steps a user takes to achieve this goal, noting potential pain points and decision points.
3. Final step: Propose specific UX/UI changes and outline an A/B testing strategy to validate the impact of these changes on the user journey.

## PROJECT 6: Actionable Web Analytics Reporting System
**Pitch:** I designed a framework for transforming raw web analytics data into actionable business insights for website optimization.
**Tech:** Google Data Studio (Simulated), Google Analytics, SQL (Conceptual)
**Details:** I created a series of custom reports focusing on key metrics like acquisition channels, user behavior flows, and conversion rates, using simulated Google Analytics data. The framework includes data interpretation guidelines and suggested strategic interventions.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype: Identify critical website metrics that directly impact business goals (e.g., conversions, bounce rate, time on page).
2. Next step: Use a reporting tool (e.g., Google Data Studio with sample data) to build a dashboard that visualizes these metrics.
3. Final step: Develop a commentary or guide for interpreting the data trends and generating specific, actionable recommendations for website improvement.

---
## PROJECT 7: Competitive Website Feature & UX Benchmarking
**Pitch:** I conducted a comparative analysis of competitor websites to identify best practices and strategic opportunities.
**Tech:** Manual Analysis, Feature Matrix (Excel/Sheets), Heuristic Evaluation
**Details:** I performed a feature-by-feature and UX analysis across several industry-leading websites, documenting common patterns, innovative solutions, and potential areas for differentiation. This research informs strategic website development and enhancement.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype: Select 3-5 direct competitors or industry leaders in a specific niche.
2. Next step: Create a detailed matrix to compare features, content types, navigation, and user experience elements across these websites.
3. Final step: Summarize key findings, identify competitive advantages, and propose actionable recommendations for improving a hypothetical website based on the benchmark.

## PROJECT 8: Website Migration Strategy & Risk Mitigation Plan
**Pitch:** I developed a comprehensive strategy and risk assessment plan for migrating a complex website to a new platform or infrastructure.
**Tech:** Project Management Tool (Conceptual), SEO Audit Tools, Risk Assessment Matrix
**Details:** I outlined a phased migration approach covering data backup, SEO considerations (301 redirects), content transfer, and post-migration testing protocols. The plan included a detailed risk matrix and mitigation strategies for potential issues.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype: Choose a hypothetical scenario (e.g., migrating a large e-commerce site to a new CMS).
2. Next step: Outline the key phases of a website migration (pre-migration, migration, post-migration), considering SEO, content, and technical aspects.
3. Final step: Develop a risk assessment matrix, identifying potential issues at each phase and proposing concrete mitigation strategies to ensure a smooth transition.
