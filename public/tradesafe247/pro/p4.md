# Website Content Optimization Framework

## 1. Strategic Objectives
*   **Search Intent Alignment:** Ensure every page serves a specific user goal (Informational, Transactional, or Navigational).
*   **E-E-A-T Compliance:** Demonstrate Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness.
*   **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO):** Structure data so it can be easily parsed and cited by AI search engines.

## 2. SEO Optimization Checklist

| Category | Action Item | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **On-Page** | Keyword Mapping | Assign one primary keyword and 3-5 LSI (latent semantic indexing) keywords per page. |
| **On-Page** | Header Hierarchy | Use one H1 tag per page; ensure H2s and H3s include semantic variations of the topic. |
| **Technical** | Core Web Vitals | Optimize images (WebP) and enable lazy loading to maintain high PageSpeed scores. |
| **Technical** | Schema Markup | Implement JSON-LD (Article, FAQ, or Product) to help search engines understand context. |
| **Content** | Information Gain | Add unique data, original images, or case studies to differentiate from top-ranking competitors. |
| **UX/UI** | Internal Linking | Use descriptive anchor text to link to relevant "Pillar Pages" and increase topical authority. |
| **Mobile** | Responsive Audit | Ensure all buttons are "tap-friendly" (min 44x44px) and fonts are legible on small screens. |

## 3. Maintenance Schedule
*   **Weekly:** Monitor Google Search Console for crawl errors.
*   **Monthly:** Update top 5 performing posts with fresh stats or new internal links.
*   **Quarterly:** Conduct a full content audit to prune or consolidate underperforming pages.
