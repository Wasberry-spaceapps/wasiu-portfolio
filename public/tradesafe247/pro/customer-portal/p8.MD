# Customer Feedback System Design

## 1. The Feedback Loop
1.  **Collection:** Trigger surveys at high-intent moments (Purchase, Onboarding, Support).
2.  **Analysis:** Use AI to categorize open-ended responses into themes (e.g., "Pricing," "Usability").
3.  **Distribution:** Route feedback to the relevant department (Product, Sales, or Support).
4.  **Closing the Loop:** Contact the customer to inform them of changes made based on their input.

## 2. Survey Templates

### Template A: Net Promoter Score (NPS)
*   **Question:** "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend our service to a friend or colleague?"
*   **Logic:**
    *   *Promoters (9-10):* Follow up with a request for a testimonial or referral.
    *   *Passives (7-8):* Ask, "What is one thing we could do to earn a 10?"
    *   *Detractors (0-6):* Immediate alert to Customer Success for recovery.

### Template B: Customer Effort Score (CES)
*   **Objective:** To measure the ease of interaction.
*   **Question:** "To what extent do you agree with the following: [Company] made it easy for me to handle my issue?"
*   **Scale:** 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree).

### Template C: Product Feature Feedback
*   **Question:** "Which of the following features do you use most often?" (Select up to 3)
*   **Question:** "What is one feature you feel is missing from your current workflow?" (Open-ended)

## 3. Reporting Metrics
*   **Response Rate:** Target > 15%.
*   **Sentiment Score:** Average sentiment of open-ended text.
*   **Time to Resolve:** Average time taken to contact a dissatisfied customer.
