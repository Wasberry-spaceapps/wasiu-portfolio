# Customer Profile Management Workflow

## 1. Workflow Visualization
**[Ingestion]** → **[Validation]** → **[Centralization]** → **[Segmentation]** → **[Activation]**

1. **Ingestion:** Data flows from Web Forms, CRM, and Support Tickets.
2. **Validation:** System checks for duplicate emails and valid phone formats.
3. **Centralization:** Data is merged into a Unified Customer View (UCV).
4. **Segmentation:** Profiles are tagged by behavior (e.g., "High Spender," "At-Risk").
5. **Activation:** Segmented data triggers automated email/SMS marketing.

## 2. Process Steps

| Step | Action | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1: Capture** | Collect zero-party data via preference centers and sign-up forms. | Marketing Team |
| **Step 2: Clean** | Remove bot entries and standardize addresses/names weekly. | Data Admin |
| **Step 3: Enrich** | Use tools (Clearbit/Apollo) to add firmographic data to B2B leads. | Sales Ops |
| **Step 4: Update** | Trigger profile updates based on "Last Active" timestamps. | Automation Engine |

## 3. Governance & Compliance
*   **GDPR/CCPA:** Ensure all profiles have an "Opt-in" timestamp and a visible "Right to be Forgotten" link.
*   **Data Security:** Encrypt PII (Personally Identifiable Information) at rest and in transit.
*   **Audit Trail:** Maintain logs of who accessed or modified customer records.
