# WordPress SOP: Backup, Security, and Updates

## SOP 01: Backup Procedures
*   **Automated Frequency:** Daily (Database) and Weekly (Full Site).
*   **Off-site Storage:** Backups must be stored on a remote server (e.g., AWS S3, Google Drive), never only on the hosting server.
*   **Verification:** Perform a monthly "Restore Drill" on a staging environment to ensure backup integrity.

## SOP 02: Security Protocols
*   **Authentication:** 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) is mandatory for all Administrator and Editor roles.
*   **Access Control:** Follow the "Principle of Least Privilege." Delete unused accounts monthly.
*   **Hardening:** 
    *   Disable XML-RPC.
    *   Change the default `wp-admin` login URL.
    *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
