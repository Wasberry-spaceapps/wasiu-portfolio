# STRATEGY: PERSONAL AMAZON ONLINE STORE
Build these prototypes to demonstrate CAPABILITY.

## PROJECT 1: Intelligent Email Triage System
**Pitch:** I developed a prototype system to automate email classification and draft responses for an e-commerce operation.
**Tech:** Python, NLTK, Flask
**Details:** I built a Python application using natural language processing (NLP) to categorize incoming customer emails into predefined types like 'order inquiry' or 'return request.' This system then generates templated draft responses, significantly reducing manual effort.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build a custom NLP model for email classification tailored to e-commerce inquiries.
2. Next step, integrate a templating engine to generate dynamic and personalized response drafts.
3. Final step, develop a simple web interface for easy review and dispatch of suggested email responses.

## PROJECT 3: Automated Price Change Alert System
**Pitch:** I engineered a personal notification system to track Amazon product price fluctuations for competitive analysis.
**Tech:** Python, BeautifulSoup, AWS SNS
**Details:** I developed a Python script leveraging web scraping techniques to periodically monitor specific Amazon product listings for price changes. The system then sends automated alerts via email or an internal messaging platform, enabling proactive competitive pricing strategies.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to set up a periodic web scraping job for Amazon product data.
2. Next step, implement logic for detecting price changes and defining alert thresholds.
3. Final step, integrate with a notification service (e.g., AWS SNS, email API) for real-time alerts.
