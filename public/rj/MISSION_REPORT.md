# STRATEGY: RJ
Build these prototypes to demonstrate CAPABILITY.

## PROJECT 1: Automated Multi-Platform Content Scheduler
**Pitch:** I designed and built a personal tool to automate the scheduling and posting of social media content across multiple platforms.
**Tech:** Python, APIs (Twitter, Facebook Graph), PostgreSQL
**Details:** I developed a Python script leveraging respective platform APIs (e.g., Facebook Graph API, Twitter API) to manage content queues. This system allows for bulk scheduling of posts, ensuring consistent brand presence and optimal timing for engagement.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by setting up API access for target social platforms.
2. Next step involves writing Python functions for content aggregation and scheduling logic.
3. Final step is creating a simple CLI or web interface for easy content input and queue management.

## PROJECT 2: Social Media Performance & Engagement Dashboard
**Pitch:** I created a custom web application to visualize and analyze social media engagement metrics in real-time.
**Tech:** React.js, Node.js, D3.js
**Details:** I developed a React-based front-end that connects to a backend pulling data from social media analytics endpoints. This dashboard provides a consolidated view of likes, shares, comments, and reach across different campaigns and platforms.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by connecting to social media analytics APIs (e.g., Instagram Graph API, Google Analytics for website traffic from social).
2. Next step is designing the data model and building API endpoints to serve processed data to the front-end.
3. Final step is developing interactive charts and visualizations using a JavaScript library like D3.js or Chart.js.

## PROJECT 3: Dynamic Content Variation Generator
**Pitch:** I engineered a script to automatically generate multiple variations of social media captions and headlines from a single input.
**Tech:** Python, NLTK, OpenAI API
**Details:** I built a Python program that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a custom ruleset to rephrase and expand initial content ideas. This system aims to prevent content fatigue and optimize for different platform algorithms and audience segments.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by defining core content components (e.g., hook, call-to-action, hashtags).
2. Next step involves integrating an NLP library or API (like OpenAI's GPT) for text generation and rephrasing.
3. Final step is creating templates and rules to guide the generation of diverse and contextually relevant content variations.

## PROJECT 4: Audience Persona & Content Mapping Strategy
**Pitch:** I developed a comprehensive strategy for identifying key audience personas and mapping specific content types to their interests and platform behaviors.
**Tech:** Google Sheets, Market Research Tools, Customer.io
**Details:** I conducted a case study using simulated demographic and psychographic data to segment potential social media audiences. This analysis informed a content matrix, recommending optimal formats, tones, and channels for each persona to maximize engagement.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by gathering demographic and psychographic data through surveys or public datasets.
2. Next step is segmenting the audience into distinct personas and outlining their media consumption habits and content preferences.
3. Final step is creating a detailed content map, linking specific content types and themes to each persona and their preferred social channels.

## PROJECT 5: Cross-Platform Content Repurposing Workflow
**Pitch:** I designed an optimized workflow and template system for efficiently adapting a single piece of long-form content into multiple social media assets.
**Tech:** Canva, Asana, Google Docs
**Details:** I created a systematic process, complete with checklists and modular templates, for transforming blog posts or videos into Instagram carousels, Twitter threads, LinkedIn articles, and TikTok snippets. This workflow drastically reduces content creation time while maintaining brand consistency.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by identifying core content assets and target social platforms.
2. Next step involves breaking down existing content into atomic units and designing platform-specific templates (visual and textual).
3. Final step is documenting the end-to-end workflow, including tools, roles, and review stages, to ensure seamless execution.

## PROJECT 6: Competitor Social Strategy Analysis Framework
**Pitch:** I developed a structured framework for analyzing competitor social media strategies to identify opportunities and gaps in content and engagement.
**Tech:** Excel/Google Sheets, SEMrush, Hootsuite Analytics
**Details:** I built a detailed spreadsheet model and methodology for tracking competitor posting frequency, content themes, engagement rates, and audience sentiment. This framework provides actionable insights for refining a brand's own social media approach and differentiating its voice.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by selecting key competitors and defining specific metrics for tracking (e.g., post volume, content types, engagement rate).
2. Next step is collecting and categorizing competitor data over a defined period.
3. Final step is synthesizing findings into a SWOT analysis for content, identifying successful tactics and areas for differentiation.

## PROJECT 7: Trend Spotting & Content Ideation System
**Pitch:** I created a systematic approach for identifying emerging social media trends and translating them into relevant, high-impact content ideas.
**Tech:** Google Trends, BuzzSumo, Miro
**Details:** I designed a multi-step process incorporating trend-monitoring tools, social listening, and brainstorming techniques to capture cultural shifts and viral topics. This system provides a consistent pipeline of fresh, timely content ideas aligned with brand values.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by setting up alerts and monitoring relevant keywords and hashtags across platforms and news sources.
2. Next step involves categorizing identified trends by relevance, potential reach, and brand fit.
3. Final step is developing a brainstorming matrix to generate diverse content concepts from each validated trend, including format and platform considerations.

## PROJECT 8: Social Media Crisis Communication Playbook
**Pitch:** I developed a comprehensive playbook for rapid and effective communication during a simulated social media crisis.
**Tech:** Google Drive, Slack, Meltwater
**Details:** I built a structured response plan outlining step-by-step procedures for monitoring, assessing, and responding to negative sentiment or PR issues. This playbook includes pre-approved messaging templates, stakeholder communication protocols, and escalation paths to mitigate reputational damage.
**Execution Guide:**
1. How to build this prototype by identifying potential crisis scenarios relevant to a brand or industry.
2. Next step involves drafting pre-approved holding statements and FAQs, and defining internal communication flows.
3. Final step is creating an escalation matrix and decision-making framework for various crisis levels, including a post-crisis review process.
