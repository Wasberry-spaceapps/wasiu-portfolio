# STRATEGY: AMERICAN FRUIT
Build these prototypes to demonstrate CAPABILITY, not just automation.

## PROJECT 1: Market Intelligence Aggregator
**Pitch:** I designed and implemented a system to centralize and process diverse market data streams, providing a consolidated view of industry trends.
**Tech:** Python, REST APIs, PostgreSQL
**Execution Guide (15-30 mins):**
1. Set up a basic Python script to fetch data from a public API (e.g., weather, stock prices) and display it.
2. Store the fetched data into a simple SQLite database locally, creating a basic data repository.
3. Build a Flask API to serve this data, demonstrating a minimal data integration pipeline for consumption.

## PROJECT 2: Dynamic Pricing Insight Dashboard
**Pitch:** I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize competitor pricing strategies and market positioning in real-time.
**Tech:** React, Python Flask, SQL
**Execution Guide (15-30 mins):**
1. Create a static HTML page with placeholder charts using a simple library like Chart.js or D3.js.
2. Build a simple Python Flask API endpoint that returns sample JSON data for products and prices.
3. Connect your HTML page to fetch and render this data dynamically using JavaScript, simulating a live dashboard.

## PROJECT 3: Website Content Synchronization Engine
**Pitch:** I engineered a robust system for the automated and accurate synchronization of internal product data with the public-facing website.
**Tech:** Python, Django/Node.js, PostgreSQL
**Execution Guide (15-30 mins):**
1. Set up a local database (e.g., SQLite) with a simple 'products' table containing relevant fields.
2. Write a Python script to query this database and format the results into a structured output (e.g., JSON).
3. Extend the script to simulate pushing this formatted data to a 'dummy' website endpoint, demonstrating the synchronization process.

## PROJECT 4: Competitor Landscape Analyzer
**Pitch:** I led the analytical framework development to systematically track and evaluate competitor website features, content, and technological shifts.
**Tech:** Excel, SQL, Power Query
**Execution Guide (15-30 mins):**
1. Collect competitor data manually into a Google Sheet or Excel (e.g., features, pricing tiers, unique selling points).
2. Use basic Excel formulas (VLOOKUP, IF, COUNTIF) to categorize and compare data points across competitors.
3. Create simple pivot tables and charts to visualize initial insights into competitive strengths and weaknesses.

---
## PROJECT 5: Market Trend Forecasting Model
**Pitch:** I developed and deployed a quantitative model for identifying and projecting emerging market trends based on aggregated external data.
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
**Execution Guide (15-30 mins):**
1. Find a public time-series dataset (e.g., stock prices, sales data from a public source) and download it.
2. Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame in a Python notebook and perform basic data cleaning and exploration.
3. Calculate a simple rolling average and plot it against the original data to visually identify and project basic trends.

## PROJECT 6: Database Integrity & Governance Framework
**Pitch:** I established a comprehensive framework and set of procedures for ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of our core company database.
**Tech:** SQL, Alteryx, Excel
**Execution Guide (15-30 mins):**
1. Identify common data errors in a small CSV dataset (e.g., missing values, incorrect formats, duplicates).
2. Use Excel's data validation features to prevent new errors and highlight existing ones in a sample column.
3. Write a simple SQL query to find duplicate records or null values in a sample table, demonstrating basic data integrity checks.

## PROJECT 7: Website Pricing Rule Engine Enhancer
**Pitch:** I optimized the logic and rules governing our website's automated pricing updates, ensuring alignment with market dynamics and business objectives.
**Tech:** SQL, Python, Tableau/Power BI
**Execution Guide (15-30 mins):**
1. Define a simple pricing rule (e.g., 'if stock < 10, then add 5% margin') for a fictional product.
2. Implement this rule using an IF statement in Excel on a sample product list with varying stock levels.
3. Discuss how this rule could be translated into a SQL 'CASE' statement for dynamic application within a database pricing engine.

---
## PROJECT 8: Data-Driven Product Catalog Rationalization
**Pitch:** I led an analytical effort to evaluate the performance and competitive positioning of products within our catalog, informing strategic adjustments.
**Tech:** Excel, Power Query, Google Sheets
**Execution Guide (15-30 mins):**
1. Collect sales data and basic product attributes for a few products into an Excel sheet.
2. Use basic formulas (SUM, AVERAGE, RANK) to calculate performance metrics for each product.
3. Create a simple bar chart or pivot table to visualize sales per product and identify top performers or underperformers.
