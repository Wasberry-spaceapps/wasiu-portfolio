SWOT Analysis Methodology (Social Media Specific)Use this framework to analyze one specific competitor or the landscape as a whole.Strengths (Internal/Their Advantage)What are they doing that we cannot easily replicate?Examples: High budget for video production, CEO is a known influencer, exclusive access to industry data, legacy verification status.Weaknesses (Internal/Their Disadvantage)Where are they failing or ignoring their audience?Examples: They don't reply to comments, their graphics are outdated, they only post self-promotional links, they are absent on emerging platforms (e.g., Threads/TikTok).Opportunities (External/Our Gap)What gap in the market can we fill?Examples:Competitor is too formal: We can be the "fun/relatable" alternative.Competitor ignores customer support: We can build a reputation for "fastest replies."Competitor uses stock photos: We can use real employee photos.Threats (External/Market Risks)What market moves could hurt us?Examples: Competitor just launched a massive influencer campaign, platform algorithm changes favoring their preferred format (e.g., video priority), aggressive poaching of our community members.4. Action Plan: The "Pivot"Based on the analysis, choose one strategic pivot.The Content Gap: "Competitor A writes long blogs. We will turn those topics into 60-second videos."The Service Gap: "Competitor B has complaints about slow support. We will implement a chatbot and 1-hour response SLA."The Platform Gap: "No one in our niche is dominating YouTube Shorts. We will claim that space."
