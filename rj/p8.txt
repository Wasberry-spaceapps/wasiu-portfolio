Handle via Community Manager.Level 2: The Blaze (Medium)Signs: Negative sentiment spreading to multiple platforms, influencers commenting, volume spike >50%.Action: Escalate to PR/CMO. Pause scheduled posts.Level 3: The Inferno (High)Signs: Mainstream news pickup, trending hashtags (e.g., #BoycottBrand), legal implications.Action: Activate Crisis War Room. Full silence on promo content. CEO statement required.2. The "First 60 Minutes" ProtocolSpeed kills rumors. Silence breeds speculation.0-15 Mins: Acknowledge the issue internally. Alert the Crisis Team.15-30 Mins: Pause ALL scheduled social media posts (Buffer/Hootsuite). You do not want a "Happy Monday!" post going out during a PR disaster.30-45 Mins: Assess facts. Is it true? Who is affected?45-60 Mins: Issue a "Holding Statement." (See templates below).3. Pre-Approved Message TemplatesScenario A: Technical Outage / Service DownTone: Transparent, Urgent, Apologetic.Tweet/Status:"We are aware that some users are experiencing issues with [Service/Product]. Our engineering team is currently investigating and working on a fix.We apologize for the interruption and will provide an update in [Time Frame, e.g., 30 mins]. Check [Status Page Link] for real-time updates."Scenario B: Insensitive/Offensive Post (Accidental)Tone: Humble, Owning the mistake, No excuses.Post:"Earlier today, we shared a post that was insensitive and missed the mark. We have deleted it.We apologize to [Affected Group] and our community. We failed to vet this content properly, and we are reviewing our internal approval processes to ensure this doesn't happen again. We are listening and learning."Scenario C: Viral Customer Complaint (The "David vs. Goliath")Tone: Empathetic, Human, Action-oriented.Reply to user (Public):"Hi [Name], we are truly sorry to hear about this experience. This is not the standard we strive for. I have escalated this to our leadership team.Please DM us your reference number/contact info so we can resolve this immediately. - [Name of Support Lead]"4. The "Do Not" List (Rules of Engagement)DO NOT Delete comments (unless they violate ToS/Hate Speech). Deleting valid criticism looks like a cover-up (Streisand Effect).DO NOT Argue. Never get into a "comment battle." Take it offline/DM immediately.DO NOT Use automated replies. Turn off chatbots if they are giving cheerful, irrelevant answers to angry people.DO NOT Joke. Humor is the first thing to go in a crisis. Be boring, be helpful.5. Post-Crisis RecoveryConduct a Post-Mortem: What happened? Why? How do we prevent it?Slow Re-entry: Wait 24–48 hours after sentiment normalizes before resuming standard marketing.Bury the Negative: (Optional) Launch high-engagement, positive community content to push negative posts down in the feed.
